# 🤖 Machine Learning & Data Science Hub

> A curated collection of machine learning implementations, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling projects.

This repository serves as a centralized vault for my technical practices, ranging from classical statistical models to deep neural networks.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The projects are categorized by learning paradigm and complexity:

### 1. 🎯 Supervised Learning
*   **[Classification](./Classification)**: Implementation of Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression for discrete outcome prediction.
*   **[Regression](./Regression)**: Simple and Multiple Linear Regression models for continuous variable estimation and trend analysis.

### 2. 🧩 Unsupervised Learning
*   **[Clustering](./Clustering)**: Data segmentation using K-Means and Hierarchical clustering. Includes Elbow Method analysis and PCA for cluster visualization.

### 3. 🧠 Deep Learning
*   **[Deep Learning](./Deep_Learning)**: Advanced neural network architectures using TensorFlow/Keras. Includes CNNs for image classification and optimization techniques like Dropout and Early Stopping.

## 🚀 Getting Started
Every subfolder contains its own self-contained `.ipynb` notebook. To explore the code:

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install combined dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow
    ```
3.  Launch Jupyter Lab or open the `.pdf` reports for a quick summary of results.
